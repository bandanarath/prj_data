DEscriptive Analysis
--> describe and interpret --> but no decision
e.g. -->census data
exploratory analysis
-->finding co-relation -->but not final say -->not prediction

-->discover new analysis

e.g --> brain analysis
e.g --> John hokins--> sky data


Inference Analysis

---> Small data and apply to larger volume
---> uncertainty of quantity
e.g. air polution vs life expectatncy


Prediction analysis

x predicts y
but not x causes y

e,g, polling predict next presidental candidate
preidct charactersitcs of people

causal analysis

change value of one variable changes the other
e.g. drug to people might raise life expectatncy

Mechanistic analysis - very rare in data science

exact chnage in one variable chnages exact in other

-->used in engineering
--?measurement area
--> chnages in pavement design will lead the function of pavement
